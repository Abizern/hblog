I gave a short presentation to the London iPhone Developer Group at the Apple
store in London this week.

20 minutes is far too short to cover such a large subject but I did what I
could. I have been given another opportunity to present in the future and I'm
going to skip the boring beginner bits and just cover 3 or 4 advanced Git
techniques which should be more fun.

For what it's worth, here are the slides. Probably not much help unless you were
there (I prefer more talk and less slides) and I apologise for being weak and
using bullet points.
