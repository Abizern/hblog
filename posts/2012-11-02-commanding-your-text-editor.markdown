There's a recent post up on the PeepCode Blog about
[Commanding Your Text Editor](https://peepcode.com/blog/2012/commanding-your-text-editor)

More and more of our time is spent at a keyboard typing, whether you're a
programmer or not. Those of you who know me will have heard me talking about the
Dvorak keyboard layout and my current attraction to Emacs.

You don't have to go that far down the rabbit hole, but it's surprising how many
Emacs bindings are supported natively on the Mac, and unlike Vim; you don't need
to be in a different mode to use them.
