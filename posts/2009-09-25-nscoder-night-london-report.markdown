The first London NSCoder Night was a success!

Eleven people turned up, travelling from as far as Brighton and Reading to join
in the fun. There was a mix of indies, learners, small Mac shops and students.

We started off upstairs at the [Bunch of Grapes](http://bunchofgrapesborough.com/) and then moved to the outside area for more room. The tables outside are at a comfortable height for standing around so people were able to move around to different groups. There was a food, drink and talk and the laptops came out a few times as well.

We decided that this is going to be a regular event, held at the same place on the **third Tuesday of the month**. Next time I'll book a table upstairs so we can sit down more comfortably. You don't need to tell me you're coming, but I'd appreciate an idea of how many people are going to make it so I can reserve approximately the right number of seats.

Thanks everyone for coming out. It was a great night and I hope you all went home with as much enthusiasm for coding as I did.
