title: Staying Flash-free on a MacBook Air
tags: technology
---

You may have seen John Gruber's posts on
[uninstalling system-wide flash](http://daringfireball.net/2010/11/flash_free_and_cheating_with_google_chrome)
and
[changing the Safari User Agent](http://daringfireball.net/2010/11/masquerading_as_mobile_safari)
to view some sites that have Flash content.

The new MacBook Airs don't have Flash installed by default so this is a
[tl:dr](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Too_long;_didn%27t_read) summary
of those two articles so you don't have to download and install the system-wide
Flash player.

Many sites, such as [YouTube](http://youtube.com), provide content in an
alternative format for devices that do not have Flash installed. Get access to
this from Safari by turning on the 'Develop' menu (Preferences | Advanced) and
change the User Agent to 'Mobile Safari 3.2.2 iPad'. This works per tab|window
so doesn't change the display in what you already have open.

If this still doesn't work (I'm looking at you
[iPlayer](http://www.bbc.co.uk/iplayer/)) then you can use Google's Chrome
browser, which comes with its own Flash plug-in.
