I seem to have accrued a stack of fiction that I haven't got around to
reading. This is just a stick in the ground so I remember to dig them up and
read them at some time:

- **Anathem** by Neal Stephenson
- **Reamde** by Neal Stephenson
- **Embassytown** by China Mieville
- **Kraken** by China Mieville
- **Zoo City** by Lauren Beukes
- **The Namesake** by Jhumpa Lahiri
- **Vellum** by Hal Duncan
- **Zero History** by William Gibson

I'm sure there are a couple more that I've missed out, but these are the ones
that I'm aware of.
