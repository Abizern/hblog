This is the obligatory post announcing that I've moved this site off Wordpress
to [Octopress](http://Octopress.org "Octopress - The blogging framework for
hackers"). It's been almost a year since I posted anything. And most of what I
did publish was about [NSCoder Night](http://nscodernightlondon.com "NSCoder
Night London's page").

The old site had the Solarized Dark theme - and once I saw that the code
formatting on Octopress was that by default I decided to make the move. Now I
can happily write Markdown formatted posts with Emacs and see an almost live
preview of how it will look when published. I get to keep it on
[GitHub](http://github.com "GitHub") and have it in a repository.

I've tried to set the general colours to Solarized Light. Seems okay so far but
still plenty of room for tweaking.
