## About

![Avatars](/images/avatars.jpg)

I am a freelance and iOS and macOS developer based in London. I use Xcode, Git and Emacs. I have a collection of
fountain pens, I ride a fixed wheel bike, enjoy scuba diving and occasionally I'll strum my guitar.

You can find me online, mostly with the username `abizern`, and the avatar image that I use almost everywhere is based
on this photograph of me. A bit old, and I should really have had a shave, but it's me.


My DVCS of choice is [Git](http://git-scm.com "Main Git site"), and I intermittently blog about it
at [365Git](http://365git.tumblr.com). Although I much prefer talking about it, and most of my speaking history used to
be on this subject, but lately I've been able to speak on a variety of other subjects around developing for Apple's platforms.

I type using the Dvorak keyboard layout - but leave the actual keyboard in the QWERTY layout. It stops me looking at the
keyboard. It took a good few months before I was able to type properly, but I'm glad I did it. I only wish iOS devices
had the Dvorak option.

I organise the monthly [NSCoder Night London](http://nscodernightlondon.com "NSCoder Night London") meetings where Cocoa
develepers can get together to share some knowledge, fix a some bugs and have a litle downtime.

### Site Comments

There are no comments on this site. Rather - there are no unmoderated comments on this site. I used to have a Wordpress
blog with comments, but the signal got drowned out in the noise. Feel free to <a

me instead; I might even edit my posts to take account of feedback.

## Availability
I'm not currently available for contract work until at least March 2017, but please feel free to get in touch by <a
