I'm an independent Mac OS and iOS developer and Git fiend in London. I use
Xcode, and Emacs. I have a collection of fountain pens, I ride a fixed wheel
bike, enjoy scuba diving and occasionally I'll strum my guitar.

You can find me online, mostly with the username `abizern`, and the avatar image that I
use almost everywhere is based on this photograph of me. A bit old, and I should
really have had a shave, but it's me.

My DVCS of choice is [Git](http://git-scm.com "Main Git site"), and I
intermittently blog about it at [365Git](http://365git.tumblr.com).

I type using the Dvorak keyboard layout - but my actual keyboard is still in
the QWERTY configuration. It stops me looking at the keyboard. It took a good
few months before I was able to type properly, but I'm glad I did it. I only
wish iOS devices had the Dvorak option.

I  organise the monthly [NSCoder Night London](http://nscodernightlondon.com
"NSCoder Night London") meetings where Cocoa develepers can get together to
share some knowledge and have a litle downtime.

There are no comments on this site. Rather - there are no unmoderated comments
on this site. I used to have a Wordpress blog with comments, but the signal got
drowned out in the noise. Feel free to <a
