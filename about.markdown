## About

![Avatars](/images/avatars.jpg)

I am a freelance OS X and iOS developer based in London. I use Xcode, Git and
Emacs. I have a collection of fountain pens, I ride a fixed wheel bike, enjoy
scuba diving and occasionally I'll strum my guitar.

You can find me online, mostly with the username `abizern`, and the avatar image
that I use almost everywhere is based on this photograph of me. A bit old, and I
should really have had a shave, but it's me.


My DVCS of choice is [Git](http://git-scm.com "Main Git site"), and I
intermittently blog about it at [365Git](http://365git.tumblr.com). Although I
much prefer talking about it, and most of my speaking history is on this
subject.

I type using the Dvorak keyboard layout - but leave the actual keyboard in the
QWERTY layout. It stops me looking at the keyboard. It took a good few months
before I was able to type properly, but I'm glad I did it. I only wish iOS
devices had the Dvorak option.

I organise the monthly [NSCoder Night London](http://nscodernightlondon.com
"NSCoder Night London") meetings where Cocoa develepers can get together to
share some knowledge, fix a some bugs and have a litle downtime.

### Site Comments

There are no comments on this site. Rather - there are no unmoderated comments
on this site. I used to have a Wordpress blog with comments, but the signal got
drowned out in the noise. Feel free to <a

me instead; I might even edit my posts to take account of feedback.

## Availability

## Colophon

This is a static site that is generated by [Hakyll](http://jaspervdj.be/hakyll/)
version 4. It is hosted on Github, where you can also see the

The colour scheme is taken from the
[Solarized](http://ethanschoonover.com/solarized) light palette.

The posts are invariably written using Emacs. And yes, the main font is
Helvetica; deal with it.
