### Summary

I had a chance to present a longer version of my
[Swift Summit Lightning Talk](http://abizern.org/talks/what-haskell-taught-me-about-swift/)
at [AltConf 2015](http://www.altconf.com) in San Francisco.

Just some personal thoughts on what knowing some Haskell teaches me about
writing Swift code.
