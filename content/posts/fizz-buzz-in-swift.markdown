In August 2014 I gave a talk at NSLondon about various approaches to solving
Fizz Buzz in Swift.  The video is
[available on Vimeo](http://vimeo.com/105440181) and proved to be reasonably
popular and even gained me my first mention in [iOS Dev Weekly](https://iosdevweekly.com/issues/167).

Just to make this more complete here is a link to the slides and a Swift
Playground that you can use to play around with the examples.
