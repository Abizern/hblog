It's surprising that there isn't an [NSCoder Night](http://nscodernight.com)
chapter in London. There is a monthly CocoaHeads meeting in Swindon, and the UK
Mac Dev meeting once a month in Central London, but I think that there is a gap
for an evening of coding in a social setting.

So, in the spirit of "If you build it, they will come" I'm going to try and get
this started. This Tuesday, September 22, from about 7, let's get together
at the [Bunch of Grapes](http://bunchofgrapesborough.com) pub just behind London
Bridge Station

a laptop (charged) and you can either sit and code or just chat with anyone
else. You can work on what you want. You don't have to show anyone what you're
working on; but feel free to ask and answer questions.

But, this is still just an experiment. Don't know whether it will be a weekly or
a monthly event. I'm not even sure about the location. I was there last week and
the WiFi was a little flaky. There was a party upstairs so it was busy, but
there was a high turnover (as you would expect for a pub near a train
station). I still managed to get a table. But, unless we try and get together,
we won't be able to answer these questions.

So, Come along tomorrow night. Follow
[@NSCoderNightLon](http://twitter.com/nscodernightlon) on Twitter and subscribe
to the [iCal calender](http://tinyurl.com/m5g6jb) for future meetings.

See you there.
