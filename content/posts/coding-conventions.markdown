I've just published my
[Cocoa Coding Conventions](/cocoa-coding-conventions).

Not so that it can be followed, but to provide an idea of what can be done so
that others can write their own, just as I've based mine on published
conventions.

The idea isn't to create a rod for your back when writing code, but to put some
thought into the choices that are made when writing code so that it is consistent.
