This site is now being generated by [Hakyll](http://jaspervdj.be/hakyll/)
instead of [Octopress](http://octopress.org)

It's something I've been planning on doing for a while, but feeling a bit burned
out on Objective-C / Cocoa and facing a few days downtime over the seasonal
holidays now was the time to actually do it.

Octopress is nice, and if you are just using the default theme, it's easy to get
up and running fairly quickly. But I found that updating the site for new
versions of Octopress was fragile. I actually managed to break the installation,
somehow, and that goes some way to explaining why there wasn't much posted this
year.

Hakyll is written in Haskell, and takes a little bit of work to get set up. Two
things that make this a bit more difficult than normal. But, many people have
made their site code public as
[examples](http://jaspervdj.be/hakyll/examples.html), and this is very useful
in getting started. I hope that my source shows up in that list in due
course. (**Update** - it is now!).

Despite what some wags may have said on
[Twitter](https://twitter.com/alexrozanski/status/415797308220264448); it's not
actually that hip.
