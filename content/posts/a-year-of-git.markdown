I've been inspired by Pieter Omvlee of
[Bohemian Coding](http://bohemiancoding.com) and his
[365Cocoa](http://365Cocoa.tumblr.com) to set up my own contribution.

I'm going to try and and fill a year with [git](http://git-scm.com) tips and
inspirations over at [365git](http://365git.tumblr.com). I’ve got a few weeks
worth of ideas but if anyone wants to know anything or has a suggestion, I’ll
gratefully consider them.
