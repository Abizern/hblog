It's been over a year that I've been running the NSCoder Night meetings in
London from here, but I've now moved it to a site of its own. You can now get
all the information from
[NSCoderNightLondon.com](http://nscodernightlondon.com).

Blog style entries never really worked. I hope that having everything together
in just a few pages on a site makes it easier for people who want to turn up.

I hope that it floats up higher in Google Rankings as well. This will also make
it easier for people who want to turn up.
